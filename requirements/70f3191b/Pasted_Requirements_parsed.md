The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to define the functional and non-functional requirements of the E-Commerce Platform. This document serves as a formal reference for developers, project managers, stakeholders, testers, and clients to ensure clarity, consistency, and completeness in system development. The scope of the E-Commerce Platform includes enabling customers to browse products, search and filter items based on various criteria, add items to a shopping cart, make secure online payments, track orders, and provide product reviews. In addition, administrators will be able to manage products, manage orders, manage users, and monitor sales performance and analytics through a dedicated admin interface.
The system will be developed as a web-based and mobile-responsive application. The frontend may be implemented using technologies such as React, Angular, or Next.js, while the backend may use frameworks such as Spring Boot, Node.js, or Django. The system will utilize a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL for data storage. It will integrate with third-party payment gateways such as Stripe, Razorpay, or PayPal for secure transaction processing and will be deployed on cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or GCP. The primary user classes of the system include guests who can browse products but cannot make purchases, registered users who can purchase products, track orders, and provide reviews, optional sellers who can add and manage their products in a multi-vendor setup, and administrators who have full control over system operations. The operating environment includes modern web browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari, as well as Android and iOS mobile browsers. The backend server will run on a Linux-based cloud server environment along with a dedicated database server.
The system must comply with certain design constraints, including adherence to PCI-DSS standards for payment security, mandatory use of HTTPS with SSL/TLS encryption, support for scalability with a microservices-ready architecture, implementation of RESTful API design principles, and compliance with data privacy regulations similar to GDPR standards. From a functional perspective, the platform will support user registration through email and password authentication as well as optional Google OAuth integration, with mandatory email verification. Login functionality will use JWT-based authentication and may include OAuth integration, with account locking after five failed login attempts to enhance security. Users will be able to browse products by category, brand, price range, and ratings. The system will provide keyword-based search with auto-suggestions and filtering options such as price, rating, and availability. Each product details page will display product name, description, images, price, ratings, and stock status.
The platform will include shopping cart and wishlist functionality, allowing users to add or remove products, update quantities, and view real-time price calculations. Wishlist features will enable users to save products for later and move them to the cart when desired. The checkout process will allow users to select delivery addresses, choose shipping options, select payment methods, and confirm orders. The payment integration will support credit and debit cards, UPI, net banking, and digital wallets, and it will properly handle payment success and failure scenarios. Users will be able to track order status through various stages including pending, confirmed, shipped, delivered, and cancelled.
The administrative panel will allow administrators to add, edit, and delete products, upload product images, and manage stock levels. Administrators will also be able to view and manage all orders, update order statuses, process refunds, view and manage user accounts, suspend or block users if necessary, and generate sales, revenue, and inventory reports. Non-functional requirements include high performance, with the system supporting more than 10,000 concurrent users, maintaining page load times under three seconds, and ensuring checkout response times under two seconds. Strong security measures will be implemented, including HTTPS encryption, password hashing using bcrypt or argon2, role-based access control (RBAC), and protection against SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). The system must ensure reliability with 99.9% uptime, automatic daily database backups, and failover support in case of system failure.
Scalability requirements include horizontal backend scaling, load balancer support, and compatibility with microservices architecture. Usability requirements mandate a responsive and accessible user interface compliant with WCAG standards, intuitive navigation, and clear error messaging. Maintainability requirements include a modular codebase, well-documented REST APIs using Swagger or OpenAPI, and CI/CD pipeline integration for streamlined deployment. The external interface requirements include a clean and modern user interface with product grid layout, responsive design, and optional dark/light mode support. The system must be compatible with desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. It will integrate with external software interfaces such as payment gateway APIs, email services like SendGrid or Mailgun, optional SMS services, and analytics tools.
The database will include tables such as Users, Products, Categories, Orders, Order_Items, Cart, Payments, and Reviews to ensure proper data organization and transactional integrity. The system must handle peak loads during high-traffic periods such as festive sales, ensure ACID compliance for transactional integrity, and log all financial transactions for audit purposes. The assumptions and dependencies include the availability of internet connectivity for users, operational payment gateway services, and available cloud infrastructure. Future enhancements may include AI-based product recommendation systems, chatbot support, multi-vendor marketplace functionality, subscription models, and international shipping support.
The system will be considered complete and ready for acceptance when all functional requirements are implemented, all test cases are successfully passed, payment processing operates securely and reliably, the admin panel is fully functional, and the system is successfully deployed in the production environment.
